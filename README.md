*Introduction:*
This e-commerce SQL project, developed by me, addresses the need for a robust database system. The aim is to design and implement tables for products and sales, allowing for efficient data management. The included queries provide insights into product inventory, sales analysis, and customer behaviors, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the e-commerce operation.
